<center>The History of clothes</center>
<h3>Extraction of fabrics and waving textiles were first started in the Middle East during the late Stone Age. Wearing fabric clothes began from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Knitting was first introduced as a fabric creation technique, dating 6500 BC, which is even popular in today's fabrics.</h3>
