<h1>Funny stories</h1>
<h3>So one day when I was 5 or 6 I was practicing riding my bike with my dad and I thought I could do a cool trick, like jump over a car with my bike. I tried to do that but it did not go smoothly and my dad just said that all he heard was BOOMMM!He also thought it was funny but I reminded him that is was painful cause I had to sit with an ice pack on my head. It also felt like a needle was peircing through my head.</h3>
<h2>I also have this other story when in grade 2 I had this best friend but then I played with someone else then she got mad at me. Then we were not friends anymore then we randomly became friends again.I was really confused about that.</h2>
